#Printempsdessciences
Hello reader,

This project was the object of a full week presentation at the prestigious "Printemps des Sciences" 2022-23 conference where students and teachers of Belgium gather to show new and futur advances in tech and sciences.

It was  first done a year prior in collaboration with students Raphaël Humblet, Kota Kurogi, Sylvain Powis de Tenbossche, Alexandre Roybin, Imad Sharof for the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in the context of the second year course TRAN-H201 - Projet multidisciplinaire II et gestion de projet - 202122 under the teaching of Michel Osée in the Electronics-Electromechanical departement.

The goal of the project was to design, programm and test a controllable and automatic prototype capable of drawing any basic or complex shape on a white board (or other types
of boards like it was achieved on a black teaching board during the final examination). The final product was able to draw all basic shapes like squares, circles (which were the hardest to programm), triangles etc. The more impressive results are drawings such as the world map, the logo of our college and actually any image taken on the internet that can be converted to an SVG. As such, a whole interface was coded for people visiting the stand at the Printemps des Sciences event to get us to draw their favorite picture. 

The way it is build is by having a main body on which rest the arduino board with two DC motors on each sides and a pen in the model itself attached to a servo-motor
able to lift it whenever a contour is done. 

The full report is given in the git. Enjoy !
